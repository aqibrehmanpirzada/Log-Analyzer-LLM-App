# 🚀 Log-Analyzer-LLM-App

Welcome to the **Log Analyzer App** repository! This project leverages **Streamlit** to provide a smart and interactive chatbot for analyzing logs, extracting insights, and interpreting monitoring dashboards. It aims to simplify the process of log analysis and help users make data-driven decisions through an intuitive interface. 

## 🔍 Overview

The Log Analyzer Chatbot is divided into three powerful modules:
1. **Log File Analysis**: Upload and analyze logs effortlessly.
2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Get precise answers using the power of AI and vector databases.
3. **Multimodal Dashboard Analysis**: Analyze monitoring dashboards through images and extract critical insights.
